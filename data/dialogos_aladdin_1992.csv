GENIE,principal,"So what'll it be, master?"
ALADDIN,principal,You're gonna grant me any three wishes I want?
GENIE,principal,"Ah, almost. There are a few provisos, a couple of quid pro quos"
ALADDIN,principal,Like?
GENIE,principal,"Ah, rule number one: I can't kill anybody. So don't ask. Rule two: I can't make anyone fall in love with anyone else. You little punim, there. Rule three: I can't bring people back from the dead. It's not a pretty picture, I don't like doing it! Other than that, you got it!"
ALADDIN,principal,"Ah, provisos? You mean limitations? On wishes? Some all powerful --can't even bring people back from the dead. I don't know, --he probably can't even get us out of this --"
GENIE,principal,"Excuse me? Are you lookin' at me? Did you rub my lamp? Did you wake me up, did you bring me here? And all of a sudden, you're walkin' out on me? I don't think so, not right now.

SULTAN,secundario,": I assure you, your highness, it won't happen again."
SULTAN,secundario,": My most abject and humblest apologies to you as well,"
JASMINE,principal,"At least some good will come of my being forced to marry. When I am queen, I will have the power to get rid of you."
SULTAN,secundario,"That's nice. All settled, then. Now,"
JAFAR,principal,If only I had gotten that lamp!
IAGO,secundario,"I will have the power to get rid of you! D'oh! To think--we gotta keep kissing up to that chump, and his chump daughter for the rest of our lives..."

ALADDIN,principal,"Oh, you sure showed me. Now about my three wishes-"
GENIE,principal,"Dost mine ears deceive me? Three? You are down by ONE, boy!"
ALADDIN,principal,"Ah, no--I never actually wished to get out of the"

ALADDIN,principal,"Fair deal. So, three wishes. I want them to be good. What would you wish for?"
GENIE,principal,"Me? No one's ever asked me that before. Well, in my case, ah, forget it."
ALADDIN,principal,"What? No, tell me."
GENIE,principal,Freedom.
ALADDIN,principal,You're a prisoner?
GENIE,principal,"It's all part-and-parcel, the whole Phenomenal cosmic powers! Itty bitty living space"
ALADDIN,principal,": But, oh--to be free. Not have to go ""Poof! What do you need? Poof! What do you need? Poof! What do you need?"" To be my own master, such a thing would be greater than all the magic and all the treasures in all the world! But what am I talking about, here? Let's get real here. It's not gonna happen. : Why not?"
GENIE,principal,The only way I get outta this is if my master wishes me out. So you can guess how often that's happened.
ALADDIN,principal,I'll do it. I'll set you free.
GENIE,principal,"Uh huh, right. Whoop!"
ALADDIN,principal,"No, really, I promise. After make my first two wishes, I'll use my third wish to set you free."
GENIE,principal,"Well, here's hopin'. O.K. Let's make some magic! So how 'bout it. What is it you want most?"
ALADDIN,principal,"Well, there's this girl--"
