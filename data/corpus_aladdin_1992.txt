When the wind's at your back And the sun's from the west And the sand in the glass is right Come on down, Stop on by Hop a carpet and fly To another Arabian night! Arabian nights Like Arabian days More often than not Are hotter than hot In a lot of good ways Arabian nights 'Neath Arabian moons A fool off his -- Too close, a little too close.

This is the famous Dead Sea Tupperware. Listen. Ah, still good. Wait, don't go! I can see that you're only interested in the exceptionally rare. I think then, you would be most rewarded to consider...this. Do not be fooled by its commonplace appearance. Like so many things, it is not what is outside, but what is inside that counts. This is no ordinary lamp! It once changed the course of a young man's life. A young man who liked this lamp was more than what he seemed. A diamond in the rough. Perhaps you would like to hear the tale? It begins on a dark night , where a dark man waits, with a dark purpose. : You...are late. :A thousand apologies, O patient one. : You have it, then? :I had to slit a few throats to get it. Ah, ah, ahhh! The treasure! Ouch! : Trust me, my pungent friend. You'll get what's coming to you. : What's coming to you! Awk! : Quickly, follow the trail! : At last, after all my years of searching, the : Awk! : By Allah! : Now, remember! Bring me the lamp. The rest of the treasure is yours, but the lamp is mine! : Awk, the lamp! Awk, the lamp! Jeez, where'd ya dig this bozo up? : Who disturbs my slumber? : It is I, : Know this. Only one may enter here. One whose worth lies far within. A diamond in the rough. : What are you waiting for? Go on! : Seek thee out, the diamond in the rough. : I can't believe it. I just don't believe it. We're never gonna get a hold of that stupid lamp! Just forget it. Look at this. Look at this. I'm so ticked off that I'm molting! : Patience, : Oh, there's a big surprise. That's an incred--I think I'm gonna have a heart attack and die from not surprise! What're we gonna do? We got a big problem here,a big prob- : Yes, we do. Only one may enter. I must find this one, this...diamond in the rough. : Stop, thief!

Have a cracker, pretty polly! : Your majesty certainly has a way with dumb animals. Now then, perhaps I can divine a solution to this thorny problem. : If anyone can help, it's you. : Ah, but it would require the use of the mystic blue diamond. : Uh, my ring? But it's : It is necessary to find the : Everything...will be...fine. : The diamond. : Here, : You are most gracious, my liege. Now run along and play with your little toys. : Yes...that'll be...pretty good. : I can't take it anymore! If I gotta choke down on one more of those moldy, disgusting crackers...bam!
